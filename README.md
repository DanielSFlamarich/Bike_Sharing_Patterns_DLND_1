# Bike Sharing Patterns 
A simple Neural Network is used to predict bike sharing patterns.

## Getting started
This notebook is part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. As the first project, it focuses in the coding of a simple artificial neural network using ```numpy'''


## Prerequisites
`import pytorch`
