# Bike Sharing Patterns 
A neural network is used to predict daily bike rental ridership.

## Further Explanation
This notebook is part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. As the first project, it focuses in the coding of a simple artificial neural network using ```numpy```

## Sections
1. Load and prepare data
2. Check data (EDA)
3. Dummy variables
4. Scaling target variables
5. Splitting data into train, validation and test 
6. Network building
7. Unit tests
8. Training the network and hyperparameter tuning
9. Check predictions

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 notebook 
- ```pytorch```
- ```numpy```
- ```pandas```
- ```matplotlib```
- ```torchvision```
